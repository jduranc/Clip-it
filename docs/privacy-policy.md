### ðŸ“œ Privacy Policy

Effective Date: October 17, 2025
App Name: Clip-it
Developer: Jose Duran


#### 1. Introduction

Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how Clip-it handles user information.
Our app does not collect, store, or share any personal data from users. We only use third-party services, such as Google Analytics and Google Ads (AdMob), which may collect limited information to provide app analytics and deliver ads.

By using Clip-it, you agree to this Privacy Policy.


#### 2. Information We Do Not Collect

We do not:
	â€¢	Collect or store personal data such as your name, email, or location.
	â€¢	Access, read, or store any content you create within the app (e.g., your clips, tags, or notes).
	â€¢	Create or maintain user accounts.
	â€¢	Use or store device identifiers beyond what is automatically collected by Googleâ€™s SDKs.


#### 3. Third-Party Services

We use third-party SDKs to improve user experience and measure app performance:
	â€¢	Google Analytics for Firebase â€“ used for anonymous usage statistics (e.g., screen views, device type).
	â€¢	Google Ads / AdMob â€“ used to display ads. These services may collect limited information such as your device ID, IP address, and app usage to provide relevant ads and detect fraud.

Each third-party provider has its own privacy policy:
	â€¢	Google Privacy Policy
	â€¢	Firebase Privacy Policy

We encourage you to review these policies to understand how these services handle your data.


#### 4. Data Retention and Storage

Clip-it does not store or retain any user data on its servers.
All analytics and advertising data are processed and stored by Google according to their own policies.


#### 5. Childrenâ€™s Privacy

Our app does not knowingly collect or store personal information from children under 13 (or under 16 in the EU).
If you believe a child has provided personal data through one of our third-party providers, please contact Google to request removal under their privacy process.

#### 6. Data Protection Laws Compliance

GDPR (European Union)

We comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
Because Clip-it does not process or store personal data, no Data Protection Officer is required.
Google Analytics and AdMob act as independent data controllers for any data they collect.

CCPA (California, USA)

Under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), we confirm that Clip-it does not sell or share user data.
Users have the right to opt out of personalized advertising through their device settings or by following Googleâ€™s opt-out instructions.

LGPD (Brazil)

We comply with the Lei Geral de ProteÃ§Ã£o de Dados (LGPD).
We do not process or retain personal data.

Other Regions (Asia, Canada, etc.)

We follow equivalent data protection principles, ensuring no collection, retention, or sharing of user data beyond what is handled by Googleâ€™s services.

#### 7. Your Privacy Choices

You can manage or opt out of personalized ads:
	â€¢	In your device settings under Privacy â†’ Ads â†’ Limit Ad Tracking (iOS).
	â€¢	By visiting Google Ad Settings.

If you disable ad personalization, you will still see ads, but they may be less relevant.

#### 8. Security

Since we do not handle personal data, we do not store or transmit sensitive information.
All communication with Googleâ€™s services is encrypted (HTTPS).

#### ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· Addendum for Users in France

##### Compliance with French Law  
We also comply with France's **Loi Informatique et LibertÃ©s** (French Data Protection Act) and the rules and guidance issued by the French Data Protection Authority (**CNIL**).  

##### Security & Encryption  
While our app does **not store personal data**, all communication with third-party services (e.g. Google Analytics, AdMob) is transmitted over encrypted channels (TLS/HTTPS). We commit to using appropriate technical and organizational measures, including strong encryption where applicable, to safeguard user data in transit or processing.

To the extent required under French law, we declare the use of encryption technology and comply with any local cryptographic regulatory requirements.

##### Data Breach & Notification  
In the unlikely event of a breach involving personal data (even though we do not hold such data), we will follow applicable French and EU rules, including notifying the CNIL within 72 hours when required and, if applicable, affected users.

##### Cookies, Tracking & Consent  
When offering services in France, we comply with local ePrivacy / electronic communications laws. If any identifiers, cookies, or trackers are used (e.g. for ad purposes), we ensure the French user is presented with a proper consent mechanism aligned with CNIL guidance.

##### Right to Lodge Complaints  
French users may contact the CNIL (Commission Nationale de lâ€™Informatique et des LibertÃ©s) to lodge a complaint about processing of their personal data. CNIL is the supervisory authority in France.

##### Enforcement & Liability 
If our practices were found deficient under French or EU law, the CNIL may impose enforcement actions, corrective orders, or fines (up to â‚¬20 million or 4 % of global turnover). We commit to addressing any compliance concerns promptly.

#### 9. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy periodically.
Any updates will be posted within the app and/or on our website, with the revised date shown above.
