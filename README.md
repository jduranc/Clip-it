## 1. Introduction

Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how Clip-it handles user information.
Our app does not collect, store, or share any personal data from users. We only use third-party services, such as Google Analytics and Google Ads (AdMob), which may collect limited information to provide app analytics and deliver ads.

By using Clip-it, you agree to this Privacy Policy.

‚∏ª

## 2. Information We Do Not Collect

We do not:
	‚Ä¢	Collect or store personal data such as your name, email, or location.
	‚Ä¢	Access, read, or store any content you create within the app (e.g., your clips, tags, or notes).
	‚Ä¢	Create or maintain user accounts.
	‚Ä¢	Use or store device identifiers beyond what is automatically collected by Google‚Äôs SDKs.

‚∏ª

## 3. Third-Party Services

We use third-party SDKs to improve user experience and measure app performance:
	‚Ä¢	Google Analytics for Firebase ‚Äì used for anonymous usage statistics (e.g., screen views, device type).
	‚Ä¢	Google Ads / AdMob ‚Äì used to display ads. These services may collect limited information such as your device ID, IP address, and app usage to provide relevant ads and detect fraud.

Each third-party provider has its own privacy policy:
	‚Ä¢	Google Privacy Policy
	‚Ä¢	Firebase Privacy Policy

We encourage you to review these policies to understand how these services handle your data.

## 4. Data Retention and Storage

Clip-it does not store or retain any user data on its servers.
All analytics and advertising data are processed and stored by Google according to their own policies.

‚∏ª

## 5. Children‚Äôs Privacy

Our app does not knowingly collect or store personal information from children under 13 (or under 16 in the EU).
If you believe a child has provided personal data through one of our third-party providers, please contact Google to request removal under their privacy process.

## 6. Data Protection Laws Compliance

GDPR (European Union)

We comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
Because Clip-it does not process or store personal data, no Data Protection Officer is required.
Google Analytics and AdMob act as independent data controllers for any data they collect.

Users have the right to opt out of personalized advertising through their device settings or by following Google‚Äôs opt-out instructions.

## 7. Your Privacy Choices

You can manage or opt out of personalized ads:
	‚Ä¢	In your device settings under Privacy ‚Üí Ads ‚Üí Limit Ad Tracking (iOS).
	‚Ä¢	By visiting Google Ad Settings.

If you disable ad personalization, you will still see ads, but they may be less relevant.
